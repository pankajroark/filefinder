Features:
Figure out how to reduce the index size
Give id to every file, store ids in index
  - two files, one ids, other index
  - always load ids first
  - for every new file always check and create and id if needed.

How to avoid reindexing everything everytime
  Can we benefit from git?
  How about storing a tree and keep track of mod times of each directory, that way many dirs would be avoided
    ^ will be very complex

Storage on index can be make incremental as well.
  - store deletions as new changes, never mutate the existing, except for compactions

Keep track of visited files / more important files and consider them more valueable

With every file we basically need to store more information.
